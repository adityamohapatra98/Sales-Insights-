## Project Overview
AtliQ Hardware, a company with branches across India, faced a critical challenge. Their sales were declining, and the sales director struggled to gain clear insights into the business performance due to unreliable updates and overwhelming Excel files. This lack of transparency made it difficult for leadership to make data-driven decisions.

## Approach 
To address these issues, the sales director aimed to implement a Power BI dashboard, turning raw data into actionable visual insights. I joined the data team tasked with creating a dynamic, easy-to-understand dashboard that would support timely decision-making.

## Steps Followed 

- [x] Conducted a high-level analysis using SQL to understand key data trends and issues.
- [x] Connected SQL datasets to Power BI for seamless integration.
- [x] Cleaned and transformed the data to prepare it for meaningful analysis.
- [x] Standardized currency values across transactions to ensure consistency.
- [x] Created calculated measures for KPIs and used them to build visualizations that highlight sales trends, regional performance, and customer insights.
- [x] After initial review, incorporated stakeholder feedback to refine the dashboard, enhancing clarity and usability.
- [x] Result: The Sales Insights Dashboard provided AtliQ Hardwareâ€™s leadership with a clear, transparent view of sales performance, enabling them to address business challenges proactively. This solution replaced the need for lengthy Excel reports, empowering managers to access real-time insights and make data-backed decisions with confidence.
